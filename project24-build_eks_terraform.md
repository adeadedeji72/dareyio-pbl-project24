## Building Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) With Terraform ##

In this Project:
1. I used Terraform to create a Kubernetes EKS cluster and dynamically add scalable worker nodes
1. I deployed multiple applications using HELM
1. I experienced more kubernetes objects and how to use them with Helm. Such as Dynamic provisioning of volumes to make pods stateful
1. I improved my CI/CD skills with Jenkins.

### Building EKS with Terraform ###

Create a project directory with and 'cd' into it
~~~
mkdir eks && cd eks
~~~
